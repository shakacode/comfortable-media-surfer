# ComfortableMediaSurfer

ComfortableMediaSurfer is a powerful Ruby 7.0+ CMS (Content Management System) Engine, picking up where [ComfortableMexicanSofa](https://github.com/comfy/comfortable-mexican-sofa) left off.

## Features

* The CMS keeps clear from the rest of your application
* Powerful page templating capability using [Content Tags](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/wiki/Docs:-Content-Tags)
* [Multiple Sites](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/wiki/Docs:-Sites) from a single installation
* Multi-Language Support (i18n) (ca, cs, da, de, en, es, fi, fr, gr, hr, it, ja, nb, nl, pl, pt-BR, ru, sv, tr, uk, zh-CN, zh-TW) and page localization.
* [CMS Seeds](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/wiki/Docs:-CMS-Seeds) for initial content population
* [Revision History](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/wiki/Docs:-Revisions) to revert changes
* [Extendable Admin Area](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/wiki/HowTo:-Reusing-Admin-Area) built with [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com) (responsive design). Using [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) for HTML and Markdown highlighing and [Redactor](http://imperavi.com/redactor) as the WYSIWYG editor.

## Dependencies

- File attachments are handled by [ActiveStorage](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activestorage). Make sure that you can run appropriate migrations by running: `rails active_storage:install`
- Image resizing is done with with [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php), so make sure it's installed.
- Pagination is handled by [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari).

## Compatibility

On Ruby 3.x, Rails 7.x +

## Installation

Add gem definition to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "comfortable_media_surfer", "~> 3.1.0"
```

Then from the Rails project's root run:

```
    bundle install
    rails generate comfy:cms
    rake db:migrate
```

Now take a look inside your `config/routes.rb` file. You'll see where routes attach for the admin area and content serving. Make sure that content serving route appears as a very last item or it will make all other routes to be inaccessible.

```ruby
comfy_route :cms_admin, path: "/admin"
comfy_route :cms, path: "/"
```

## Converting from ComfortableMexicanSofa or Occams

### From Sofa to Surfer

The database structure is the same.  Your Sofa project will also need to be upgraded to >= Rails 7.x  
Then you should simply be able to update your Gemfile thus, and run bundle

```ruby
gem 'comfortable_media_surfer', '~> 3.1.0'
```

### From Occams to Surfer

Again the project must be >= Rails 7.x.  Since the schema is different, executing this SQL should get you set for Surfer

```sql
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_categories RENAME TO comfy_cms_categories;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_categorizations RENAME TO comfy_cms_categorizations;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_files RENAME TO comfy_cms_files;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_fragments RENAME TO comfy_cms_fragments;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_layouts RENAME TO comfy_cms_layouts;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_pages RENAME TO comfy_cms_pages;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_revisions RENAME TO comfy_cms_revisions;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_sites RENAME TO comfy_cms_sites;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_snippets RENAME TO comfy_cms_snippets;
ALTER TABLE occams_cms_translations RENAME TO comfy_cms_translations;
UPDATE comfy_cms_fragments SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Page' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Page';
UPDATE comfy_cms_fragments SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Layout' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Layout';
UPDATE comfy_cms_fragments SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Snippet' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Snippet';
UPDATE comfy_cms_revisions SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Page' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Page';
UPDATE comfy_cms_revisions SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Layout' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Layout';
UPDATE comfy_cms_revisions SET record_type = 'Comfy::Cms::Snippet' WHERE record_type = 'Occams::Cms::Snippet';
```

## Quick Start Guide

After finishing installation you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin

Default username and password is 'user' and 'pass'. You probably want to change it right away. Admin credentials (among other things) can be found and changed in the cms initializer: [/config/initializers/comfortable_media_surfer.rb](https://github.com/shakacode/comfortable-media-surfer/blob/master/config/initializers/comfortable_media_surfer.rb)

Before creating pages and populating them with content we need to create a Site. Site defines a hostname, content path and its language.

After creating a Site, you need to make a Layout. Layout is the template of your pages; it defines some reusable content (like header and footer, for example) and places where the content goes. A very simple layout can look like this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ cms:text title }}</h1>
    {{ cms:wysiwyg content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

Once you have a layout, you may start creating pages and populating content. It's that easy.
